# [NLP] regexps

Task for Natural Language Processing course, focusing on the use of regular expressions.

[Task description](./1-regexp.md).

[Task results](./results.md)

## Running
You can either run a script `main.py` providing `1`, `2` or `3` as an argument (meaning solving task 1, 2 or 3 respectively),
or run `runall.sh` which will generate separate files with solutions for each task as well as combined `results.md`.
Both scripts need to be invoked from within a containing directory.

## Requirements
I assume input files in subdirectory `ustawy`.

Tested with:
* Python 3.6.7
* regex==2019.3.12
