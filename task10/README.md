# [NLP] Language modelling

Task for Natural Language Processing course, focusing on the language modelling.

[Task description](./10-lm.md)

[Task results (`2ndApproach`)](./2ndApproach/results.md)

## Running
The solution in main directory is not working (its runnable but doesn't give reasonable results).

The solution in `2ndApproach` directory is a refactored, non-notebook [solution of Jakub Darul](https://github.com/JakDar/nlp-lab-2019/blob/master/lab10/Lab10.ipynb). In this version it requires first installing fastai *using supplied `install_fastai.sh` script* (or by mimicking its behavior) and then by fulfilling requirements in `requirements.txt`.

## Requirements
For both solutions you have to download [weights and sentence piece model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nL3uuI6i8DMu-6GyOwRRgsFWFK4Cs-TZ/view) and extract it here, to `v50knl4` directory.

Solutions were tested with Python 3.6.7 through *Virtualenv* on Linux.
